		<h1>How to use VIM</h1>
                <h2>Code Practice Assignment</h2>
		<code>What is VIM?</code>
		<pre>It's based on shortcuts, called the Vim language, which can make coding and writing faster and more efficient.<br>With Vim, you can jump to any specific text position and rapidly make precise edits.</pre>
		<h3>Basic VIM Commands:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>":syntax on"=The rules that define the structure of a language</li>
			<li>"i" or "a"=Pressing i (for insert) will directly switch to Insert mode. Pressing a (for append) will switch to Insert mode and move the cursor after the current character.</li>
			<li>"esc"=Pressing esc will switch from Insert mode to Normal mode</li>
			<li>":wq"=To save and exit VIM.</li>
			<li>":w"=To save VIM</li>
			<li>":q"= To quit/exit VIM</li>
		</ol>

		<p>In VIM, you can <kbd>Ctrl + C</kbd> to copy and <kbd>Ctrl + V</kbd> to paste</p>
		<p>In VIM, when you make a typo mistake, it tells you at the bottom <samp>"Not an editor command"</samp> in red.</p>
