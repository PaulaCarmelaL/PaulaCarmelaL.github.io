This is my Journal 

Summarize the importance of each of these tools 
-Terminal:lets users interact with their computers in a direct way through commands. 
-GIT:allows users to manage and track chnages in the codes
-VIM:very effiecient when it comes to text-related editing tasks
-Markdown:users can use md to add formatting and other elements to simple texts.
  
Share how you're feeling so far about all of this new technology
- I am feeling very comfortable with all of this new tech and codes/commands. I understand it very quickly and can use them very easily. 

Give advice for future students who are interested in learning them
- Take your time to really understnad what each command/code does. That way all you need to worry about is remembering them all because you will already know what they do, making it easier to know when/how to use them.
