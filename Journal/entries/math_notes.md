# These are my Math Notes

## SUMMARY:
 
The relationship between a function and the graph of its derivative is such that the slope of a function helps determine the graph of the derivative. If the function f(x) has a positive slope, then the derivative f'(x), x>0 and the slope is negative then the derivative f'(x), x<0.

## Chart on f'(x) to f(x)

| If f'(x) is...  | ...then f(x) is |
|    ---------    |  ------------   |
| Positive f'(x)>0| increasing      |
| Negative f'(x)<0| decreasing      |
| Zero f'(x)=0    | constant        |

### Derivative Formula

$$f'(x)= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$$ 

### Power Formula 

$$\frac{d}{dx}(x^n)=nx^{n-1}$$
