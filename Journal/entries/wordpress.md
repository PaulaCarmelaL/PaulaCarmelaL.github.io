# My Reflection

## The three websites that I checked were: 
- [Backshop](https://www.bakeshopva.com/)
- [SideKick](https://www.sidekickbakery.com/)
- [Bayou](https://www.bayoubakeryva.com/)

### Reflection 
In Bakeshop, they had a individual pages for every one of their services. From their website, I got the idea of creating a separate page for my recipe book and the option for the people to download it. In SideKick, I liked how in their website they had a tab for other additional services like gift cards and programs. I got the idea of adding cooking classes and that being on of the pages in my website. In Bayou, they had a page dedictaed to press and everysingle paper and news that mentioned them was in that page. I got inspired and decided to do something similar. I added blogs that weren't just recipe related but also nutritional news and information. 

My experince while doing this project was really good. It all went smoothly, other than not being able to access wordpress sometimes through my MacBook. I was already a bit familiar with how Wordpress worked and on how to create a website through these sites. The tool that was the most helpful to me was the pages tab. To be able to move from one page to another and edit things was very helpful.
